"""
Identify problematic areas in Fairyfly models that make them un-simulate-able.
_
These inclue "problem regions," which identify cases where there are two or
more groups of shapes that are disconnected from one another.
_
It also includes "problem holes," which identify cases of gaps or holes within
a larger connected region of shapes.
-

    Args:
        _model: A Fairyfly Model for which problem regions are to be visualized.
        _run: Set to "True" to run the component and visualize problem areas.

    Returns:
        regions: Polylines for regions of shapes that are disconnected from one
            another and are therefore un-simulate-able.
        holes: Polylines for holes in the model that make it un-simulate-able.
        duplicates: A list of Surfaces for duplicate shape geometries in the
            model. This list will also include line segments for any duplicate
            boundaries in the model.
