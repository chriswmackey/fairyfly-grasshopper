Create parameters for THERM model exposure, that describes the model's location
within a larger building.
-

    Args:
        _model_type_: Text to indicate the type of construction detail or the purpose
            of the model. Chose from the following. (Default: Other).
            * Window
            * Opaque Wall
            * Opaque Roof
            * Other
        _cross_section_: Text to indicate the type of cross section that the model represents.
            The acceptable fields here depend upon the model_type. If unspecified,
            the default is set to the top of each list below for each model_type.
            _
            For the Window model_type, choose from the following.
            * Sill
            * Jamb
            * Head
            * Horizontal Divider
            * Vertical Divider
            * Horizontal Meeting Rail
            * Vertical Meeting Rail
            * Common Frame
            * Spacer
            _
            For the Opaque Wall and Roof model_type, choose from the following.
            * Sill Plate
            * Header
            * End Section
            * Middle Section
            * Thermal Bridge
            * Window Framing - Sill
            * Rough Opening - Header
            * Rough Opening - Jamb
            _
            For the Other model_type, choose from the following.
            * General Cross Section
            * Common Thermal Bridge
        _gravity_orient_: Text to indicate the direction of gravity for the model. If unspecified, 
            this will be computed from the orientation of the model's plane
            in the 3D scene.
            * Down
            * Up
            * Left
            * Right
            * Into Screen
            * Out Of Screen
        _wind_orient_: A number between 0 and 360 for the direction the exterior surface
            of the model faces. This orientation of the exterior surface
            is used to determine the wind direction for the simulation. (Default: 0).
            For reference, 0 = North, 90 = East, 180 = South, 270 = West.

    Returns:
        exposure: Parameters for THERM model exposure, that describes the model's
            location within a larger building. These can be connected to the
            "FF Model to THMZ" component in order to specify settings for
            the THERM simulation.
